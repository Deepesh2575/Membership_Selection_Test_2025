# Member Selection Test - Tasks & Project Submission

Welcome, candidate! This document outlines the tasks required for your submission. Please read all instructions carefully.

## Overview

This test consists of two mandatory parts:
1.  **Compulsory Questions:** A set of technical problems designed to test your foundational skills.
2.  **Mini-Project:** A practical project where you identify and solve a real-world problem.

**All parts are compulsory and must be completed.**

---

## Part 1: Compulsory Questions

You are required to solve all the questions posted in the main repository. Please ensure your solutions are well-commented and follow the submission guidelines outlined in the main instructions document.

---

## Part 2: The Mini-Project

This is your opportunity to showcase your creativity, problem-solving skills, and passion for technology.

### Objective
Your task is to create a small, functional project that addresses a persistent or interesting problem in one of the following domains:
* **Cybersecurity**
* **Blockchain & Web3**

### Your Submission
Your project folder must contain a detailed `README.md` file (this can be the main README of your project sub-folder) that includes the following sections:

1.  **Problem Statement**
    * Clearly define the problem you have chosen to address.
    * Explain why it is a significant or interesting challenge in its domain.

2.  **Your Approach**
    * Describe the strategy and methodology you used to tackle the problem.
    * Explain your design choices, the technologies you used (languages, frameworks, libraries), and why you chose them.

3.  **The Code & Explanation**
    * Include your complete, well-documented source code.
    * Provide a detailed, section-by-section explanation of how your code works. Your comments and this explanation should make it easy for a reviewer to understand your logic.

## Rules and Academic Integrity

This is the most important section. Please read it carefully.

### Resource Usage
* **Internet:** You are encouraged to use the internet for research, documentation, and learning.
* **Generative AI (GPTs):** The use of AI tools like ChatGPT is permitted for **limited work only**. You can use it for boilerplate code, debugging assistance, or conceptual understanding. **You cannot use it to generate the core logic or the entire solution.**

### **Citation is Mandatory**
You **must cite every resource** you use. Plagiarism is a serious offense, and we will use multiple tools to check the authenticity of your work.

* **How to Cite:** If you use a code snippet from Stack Overflow, a function from a tutorial, or get an idea from an AI, you must add a comment in your code right above the relevant section.
    * **Example Code Comment:**
        ```python
        # The following function to parse timestamps was adapted from:
        # URL: [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12345/how-to-parse-dates](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12345/how-to-parse-dates)
        # Accessed on: Aug 8, 2025
        def parse_my_data():
            # ... code ...
        ```
    * **Example AI Citation:**
        ```javascript
        // The structure for this API call was generated with assistance from ChatGPT.
        // Prompt: "Show me a basic fetch API call structure in JavaScript."
        // URL: [https://chat.openai.com/share/your-link-here](https://chat.openai.com/share/your-link-here)
        async function getData() {
            // ... code ...
        }
        ```

Failure to cite your sources or submitting plagiarized work **will result in immediate disqualification**. We value your original thought process far more than a "perfect" but copied solution.

Good luck!

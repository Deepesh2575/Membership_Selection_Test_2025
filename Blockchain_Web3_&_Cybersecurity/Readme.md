# *Blockchain, Web3 & Cybersecurity*
 We are a community of passionate learners and builders dedicated to exploring the frontiers of decentralised and secure digital technologies.

## *Vision*
To create a leading student-driven ecosystem that pioneers innovation, ethical awareness, and technical excellence in Blockchain, Web3, and Cybersecurity, making our institution a hub for decentralised and secure digital technologies.

## *Long-Term Objectives*
Our primary goals are to:

Foster a community of skilled individuals while cultivating a strong sense of camaraderie and collaboration.

Launch and maintain open-source projects and decentralised applications (DApps) that address real-world problems.

Host periodic events focused on Blockchain and Cybersecurity, including hackathons, bootcamps, workshops, and awareness campaigns.


By facilitating partnerships with external experts, hosting internal competitions, and building open-source projects, the club will stay aligned with its vision and meet all long-term objectives. Each planned activity â€” from Capture the Flag contests to DApp development â€” contributes incrementally toward the overarching goal of building a robust, secure, and forward-looking tech community.
